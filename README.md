## Issues and Requests

If you have an issue with one of the images or you have a request to add or change a tool on one of our images:

  1.  Create an issue in this repo
  2.  Wait for approval or comments.  Our images have real constraints.  Primarily, disk space.  So it's a value (broad adoption of that tool) vs. cost (disk space and on-going maintenance) proposition.  Specify whether you will create a PR or if you are requesting for us to add it to the image.
  3.  Optionally, create a PR.
